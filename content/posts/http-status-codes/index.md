## HTTP Status Codes: A Detailed Overview

Introduction:
HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that indicate the status of a request made to a server. They are a standard part of the HTTP protocol, which is the foundation of the World Wide Web. These codes are used by web browsers and servers to communicate the status of a request, and they play a crucial role in ensuring that web pages are loaded and displayed correctly.

Classes of HTTP Status Codes:
There are five classes of HTTP status codes, each represented by the first digit of the code. The five classes are:

1xx: Informational
2xx: Success
3xx: Redirection
4xx: Client Error
5xx: Server Error

Explanation of the Classes:

### 1xx Informational:
These codes indicate that the request has been received and is being processed. The most common 1xx code is 100 Continue, which is sent by the server to indicate that it has received the request headers and is ready to receive the body of the request.

### 2xx Success:
These codes indicate that the request has been successfully processed by the server. The most common 2xx codes are 200 OK, which is sent when a request is successfully completed, and 201 Created, which is sent when a new resource has been created as a result of the request.

### 3xx Redirection:
These codes indicate that the client needs to take additional action in order to complete the request. The most common 3xx codes are 301 Moved Permanently and 302 Found, which are used to redirect the client to a different URL.

### 4xx Client Error:
These codes indicate that the client has made an error in the request. The most common 4xx codes are 400 Bad Request, which is sent when the server cannot understand the request, and 404 Not Found, which is sent when the requested resource cannot be found.

### 5xx Server Error:
These codes indicate that an error occurred on the server while processing the request. The most common 5xx codes are 500 Internal Server Error, which is sent when the server encounters an unexpected error, and 503 Service Unavailable, which is sent when the server is temporarily unable to handle the request.

Understanding the different classes of codes and their meanings can help you troubleshoot and diagnose problems with your web pages and applications. However, it's important to keep in mind that some of these codes may not be supported by all servers or clients, and that some codes may be used for specific uses cases or in specific contexts. Also, some codes may be used for experimental or non-standard purposes.
