## Introduction

Discord is a popular platform for online communication and collaboration, and it offers a range of tools for managing and organizing your server. One of these tools is the ability to make other users moderators, which allows them to help you manage and moderate your server. In this article, we'll show you how to make someone a moderator in Discord.

## Step 1: Open Discord

To start, open the Discord app or log in to the Discord website. Then, navigate to the server you want to add a moderator to.

## Step 2: Go to Server Settings

Next, click on the server name at the top of the screen, and then click on "Server Settings." This will open the server settings page, where you can access all of the options for managing your server.

## Step 3: Click on Roles

In the server settings page, click on the "Roles" option. This will show you a list of all of the roles in your server, including the default roles and any custom roles you've created.

## Step 4: Create a Moderator Role

If you don't already have a moderator role, you'll need to create one. To do this, click on the "Create Role" button, and then give the role a name, such as "Moderator." Then, click on the "Create" button to create the role.

## Step 5: Edit the Moderator Role

Next, click on the moderator role to open the role settings. In the role settings, you'll see a list of permissions that you can assign to the role. To effectively moderate your server, I recommend granting the moderator role the following permissions:

* Manage Nicknames: This allows the moderator to change the display names of users within your server.
* Manage Messages: This permission allows the moderator to delete and edit messages within the server.
* Kick Users: This permission gives the moderator the ability to remove users from the server.
* Ban Users: This permission enables the moderator to ban users who violate your server's rules or policies.
* Timeout Members: This permission allows the moderator to temporarily mute users within the server.
* Manage Threads and Posts: This permission gives the moderator the ability to manage posts and threads within the server.
* Mute Members: This permission allows the moderator to mute members within the server.
* Deafen Members: This permission enables the moderator to deafen members within the server, which will prevent them from receiving audio or video from the server.
* Move Members: This permission gives the moderator the ability to move members from one voice channel to another within the server.

It's important to note that you can customize these permissions to fit the specific needs of your server. It is essential to establish clear guidelines and policies for moderators to follow.

## Step 6: Assign the Moderator Role to a User

Once you've edited the moderator role, you can assign it to a user. To do this, go back to the server settings page, and then click on the "Members" option. Then, find the user you want to make a moderator, and click on the "Edit" button next to their name. In the user settings, select the moderator role from the list of roles, and then click on the "Save Changes" button.

And that's it! With these steps, you can make someone a moderator in Discord, giving them the tools they need to help you manage your server.
