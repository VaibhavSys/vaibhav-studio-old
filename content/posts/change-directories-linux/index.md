Navigating the Linux file system can be a challenge for beginners, but with a few basic commands, you can easily move around your directories and files. One of the most essential commands for moving through the file system is `cd` (change directory). This command allows you to change your current working directory to another directory or location.

However, sometimes you might find yourself in a directory that you didn't mean to be in, or you might want to go back to the previous directory you were in. In these cases, you can use the `cd ..` command to go back one directory.

The `..` in the command stands for the parent directory. So, when you use `cd ..`, you are telling the system to change the current directory to the parent directory. This is useful when you want to move up one level in the file system hierarchy.

For example, let's say you're currently in the directory `/home/user/documents/work`, and you want to go back to the `/home/user/documents` directory. To do this, you would use the command `cd ..` and it will take you back to the parent directory.

Another way of going back to a directory is by using the command `cd -` which will take you to the previous directory you were in. This is useful when you have recently changed directories and want to quickly go back to the previous directory without having to remember the path.

It's also worth noting that you can also use the `cd` command with a specific directory path to move to that directory. For example, `cd /home/user/documents` will take you directly to the documents directory.

In conclusion, the `cd ..` and `cd -` commands are essential for navigating the Linux file system and make it easy to move back a directory. By using these commands, you can easily navigate to a specific directory or move up one level in the file system hierarchy. With a little practice, you'll be moving around the Linux file system like a pro.
